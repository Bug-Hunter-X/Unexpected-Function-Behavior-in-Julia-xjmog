# Julia Function Bug Report

This repository contains a report of an unexpected behavior observed in a simple Julia function. The function `my_function` is intended to square positive inputs and return 0 for non-positive inputs. However, under certain conditions, it produces unexpected outputs.  This may stem from issues like incorrect conditional logic or overlooked edge cases.

The `bug.jl` file shows the original function with the problematic behavior.  The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version.
